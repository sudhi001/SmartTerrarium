# Smart Terrarium Automation Project

This project aims to automate an in-house terrarium using IoT technology. The goal is to maintain optimal conditions within the terrarium by automatically spraying or pouring water based on the atmospheric temperature and soil humidity.

## Features

- **Automatic Watering**: The system will monitor and control the watering process based on environmental conditions.
  
- **Temperature Control**: Maintain the atmospheric temperature within a specified range to ensure a comfortable environment for plant growth.

- **Humidity Regulation**: Monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering to keep the soil adequately moist for plant health.

## Components

- **Microcontroller**: Utilizing an Arduino or ESP32 board to manage sensors and control watering mechanisms.
  
- **Sensors**: Incorporate temperature and humidity sensors to monitor environmental conditions.
  
- **Actuators**: Use pumps or valves to automate the watering process based on sensor readings.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect temperature and humidity sensors to the microcontroller.
   - Install actuators (pumps or valves) for water dispensing.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install necessary libraries for sensor and actuator control.
   - Flash the microcontroller with the provided firmware.

## Usage

1. Power on the IoT terrarium system.
2. The system will automatically monitor temperature and soil moisture.
3. Based on sensor readings, the system will activate watering mechanisms as needed.
4. View real-time data and system status via a connected interface (serial monitor or web dashboard).
